This is a project from the Odin Project and created by Mohammed Zaib.

All functionality and code was written by me.

The idea of the project was to create multiple functions working together to create a game of rock paper scissors.

a switch statement was used to create the rules and outcome of the game, in the switch function i returned the text and incremented the value of a variable that would keep the score of either win, lose or draw so that i could take those values and declare a winner.

The computerPlay function was build so that the computer would pick at random one of the choices from the array, i used math.random for this.

next gamefunction, the winner would be decided after 5 rounds so i created a while loop and made sure that the game would only last 5 rounds before deciding a winner.

the final function was the check winner, here i refer back to my varibles and then decides based on the final result.
